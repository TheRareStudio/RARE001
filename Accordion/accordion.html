	            	<p>"Why," replied Passepartout, a little vexed that his nationality should cause this question, "we Frenchmen know how to make grimaces, it is true but not any better than the Americans do." "True.  Well, if I can't take you as a servant, I can as a clown.  You see, my friend, in France they exhibit foreign clowns, and in foreign parts French clowns." "Ah!" "You are pretty strong, eh?" "Especially after a good meal." "And you can sing?" "Yes," returned Passepartout, who had formerly been wont to sing in the streets. "But can you sing standing on your head, with a top spinning on your left foot, and a sabre balanced on your right?" "Humph!  I think so," replied Passepartout, recalling the exercises of his younger days. "Well, that's enough," said the Honourable William Batulcar. The engagement was concluded there and then. Passepartout had at last found something to do.  He was engaged to act in the celebrated Japanese troupe.  It was not a very dignified position, but within a week he would be on his way to San Francisco. The performance, so noisily announced by the Honourable Mr. Batulcar, was to commence at three o'clock, and soon the deafening instruments of a Japanese orchestra resounded at the door.  Passepartout, though he had not been able to study or rehearse a part, was designated to lend the aid of his sturdy shoulders in the great exhibition of the "human pyramid," executed by the Long Noses of the god Tingou.  This "great attraction" was to close the performance. Before three o'clock the large shed was invaded by the spectators, comprising Europeans and natives, Chinese and Japanese, men, women and children, who precipitated themselves upon the narrow benches and into the boxes opposite the stage.</p>

"But can you sing standing on your head, with a top spinning on your left foot, and a sabre balanced on your right?" "Humph!  I think so," replied Passepartout, recalling the exercises of his younger days. "Well, that's enough," said the Honourable William Batulcar. The engagement was concluded there and then. Passepartout had at last found something to do.  He was engaged to act in the celebrated Japanese troupe.  It was not a very dignified position, but within a week he would be on his way to San Francisco.
